road-surface.mapcss - help with debugging surface on highways. It will show following:

  paved/asphalt/concrete/cobblestone/paving_stones -- bold white line
  all other -- brown line

  highway=track allways has brown color by defaults, other highways has gray color without any surface.

  Also surface value is printed above the road.
